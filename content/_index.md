## üéØ What We Do

Ubiquitous data in our world has brought data science to the forefront of many industries.
Data scientists are showing organizations how they can leverage data to optimize outcomes.
It's time for KC data scientists to get together, share best practices, talk about tools/models and continue to push our profession forward!
This group is geared towards data scientists doing statistical analysis, predictive modeling and visual representation.
Not a data scientist, but interested in this type of data science?
Attend the meetup and learn more about what data scientists do.
